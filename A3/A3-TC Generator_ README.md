# **Test Case Generator for Metro Map Planning Assignment**

## **1\. Overview**

This script, test\_case\_generator.py, is a tool designed to produce a wide variety of test cases for the "Metro Map Planning" assignment. It allows for the programmatic generation of .city files based on a set of specified parameters such as grid size, number of metro lines, and turn limits.  
The primary purpose of this generator is to create a comprehensive and robust test suite for evaluating student submissions. It can produce test cases that are guaranteed to be solvable, deliberately unsolvable, or completely random.

## **2\. Key Features**

* **Multiple Generation Modes:** The script can generate test cases with different solvability guarantees:  
  * constructive: Guaranteed to be **satisfiable** (solvable).  
  * unsat: Deliberately constructed to be **unsatisfiable**.  
  * random: Randomly generated, with no guarantee of solvability.  
* **Arbitrary Turn Limit (J):** The constructive mode uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) pathfinding algorithm, which can find valid, non-colliding paths for **any value of J**, not just a limited subset.  
* **Batch Generation:** The script can generate multiple test cases with a single command (--count).  
* **Reproducibility:** Test cases can be regenerated consistently by using a specific random seed (--seed), which is essential for fair grading and debugging.  
* **File Organization:** Generated files can be automatically saved to a specific directory (--outdir) with a custom filename prefix (--prefix).  
* **Full Scenario Support:** Supports both Scenario 1 (standard) and Scenario 2 (with popular cells).

## **3\. Generation Modes Explained**

The core strength of this generator lies in its different modes, which allow for the creation of a well-rounded test suite.

### **constructive (Default, Guaranteed SAT)**

This mode ensures that every generated test case has at least one valid solution.  
**How it works:**

1. It iteratively adds one metro line at a time.  
2. For each line, it samples random, unoccupied start and end points on the grid.  
3. It then uses a **BFS pathfinder** to find a valid path between these points that does not collide with existing paths and respects the turn limit J.  
4. If a path is found, its cells are marked as occupied, and the process repeats for the next line.  
5. This method is powerful because the BFS can find a path for any given J, allowing for the creation of complex but solvable problems.

If the script, when running in `constructive` mode, cannot find a valid non-colliding path for one of the metro lines, it won't get stuck in an infinite loop. It is designed to fail gracefully.

Here is the specific behavior:

1. **Retry Loop:** For each metro line it needs to create, the generator will try up to 200 times to pick a random start/end point pair and find a valid path between them.  
2. **Failure:** If, after 200 attempts, it still cannot place the line (usually because the grid is too crowded or the constraints are too tight), it concludes that it's impossible to proceed.  
3. **Action on Failure:** The script will then:  
   * Print a clear error message to the console, like this:

`Error: Failed to construct a satisfiable instance. Try a larger grid or fewer lines or Just Try again ;).`

* Immediately terminate execution.

This ensures that the generator either produces a valid, solvable `.city` file or it stops with a helpful message explaining why it failed, preventing you from getting an incomplete or invalid test case.

### **unsat (Guaranteed UNSAT)**

This mode is designed to test if a student's solver can correctly identify when a problem has no solution.  
**How it works:**

* The primary strategy is to create a logically impossible constraint. It generates a random set of metro lines but forces at least one of them to be unsolvable.  
* For example, when run with \--J 0, it ensures that the start and end points for at least one line are **not on the same row or column**, making a 0-turn path impossible.

### **random**

This is the most straightforward mode, providing a mix of easy, hard, and potentially unsolvable problems.  
**How it works:**

* It simply samples 2 \* K unique coordinates from the grid and assigns them as start and end points for the K metro lines.  
* There is no check for solvability, so the resulting test case could be trivial, complex, or impossible.

## **4\. Usage Examples**

The script is run from the command line.  
**A. Generate a simple, solvable test case:**  
python3 test\_case\_generator.py \--N 10 \--M 10 \--K 3 \--J 1 \--mode constructive \--output easy\_sat.city

**B. Generate 5 solvable test cases with a high turn limit (Scenario 2):**  
python3 test\_case\_generator.py \--N 25 \--M 25 \--K 8 \--J 4 \--P 5 \--mode constructive \--count 5 \--outdir sat\_cases \--prefix medium\_j4

**C. Generate 3 deliberately unsolvable test cases for J=0:**  
python3 test\_case\_generator.py \--N 15 \--M 15 \--K 5 \--J 0 \--mode unsat \--count 3 \--outdir unsat\_cases \--prefix j0\_impossible

**D. Generate a reproducible set of random test cases:**  
python3 test\_case\_generator.py \--N 20 \--M 20 \--K 10 \--J 3 \--mode random \--count 10 \--seed 42 \--outdir random\_seed42
